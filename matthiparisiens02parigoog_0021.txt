place,¹ that abbat Warin ol St. Alban’s (ab. 1183-
1195) had made a regulation that when anovics received
the tonsure he should 11 111 same time assume the
monastic habit, and not defer doing so till his profession
was made; and this rule, in all probability, remained in
force. The age of a novics, on admission, seems to have
varied in different monasterias. At the Benedictine
monastery of St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, the monks ob- ·

tained a papal bull in 1180, 111 to admit under 111 age ,

of fifteen,2 and this may have been in general the praa-
tice at St. Albana, until by the revision of 111 11111111
of the Benedictine Order in 1238 (by pope Gregory IX.),
the ageos probation was fixed 11 ninetcen, and of pro-
fession at twenty years of age³ Under the mle of
abbat Robert (in 1158), 1 scholar of Montreuil “aetate
juvenis‚'’ took the habit (laoditiam religionis accepit),
at St. Alban’s, and remained three years afterwards “ in
disciplina novitiali ; ”⁴ but a subsequent abbat, John de
(11111111). 1195-1214), on being applied to by ons of
the monks 1ο admit his nephew, then a boy at school,
refused to do so, “quia impubes erat, nec adhuc tantae
aetatis ut esset 1(1ο1111.”ὅ If Matthew Paria was

received as a novics in 111711 appears probable)‚ it is
difficult to reconcile the fact with his mention of occur-
renoes in the monastery some years previously. Thus,
he tells us he recollected the wonderful memory of abbat
John de Cella,6 in reference to the Psalter, so that hs
