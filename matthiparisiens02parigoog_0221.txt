London in Feb. 1614, as “brevem Historiam ejusdem
Matthaei [Parisiensis], ubi acrius invehitur in Roma·
num tyrannidem.''l Later still (in 1657), some extracta
were made from the work by Sir James Ware (MS.
Add 4783, fol. 97), who errs with Joscelin in giving
it the title of “ Ager Sterilis ;'' and at the close of
the 17th century Dr. Thomas Gale had eonsulted it,
os appears by the following note in his handwriting
in the manuscript (fol 946): “ Hic desinit Matth.
Paris Historia Misaor, qum est epitome MajoriS, quae
ad 1258 [1259] continuatur.’' Two faults are here ap-
parent, first in calling this work the Historia Minor
(and thus confounding it with the Historia Anplo-
rum), and then in stating it to be a compendium of the
Greater Ohronicle, which it certainly is not. To these
scanty notices of the work may be added the brief men·
tion made of it in a note to the second edition of (lave's

“ Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Historia Literaria,'' vol ii.

p. 298, published in 1'1'43,2 whence, no doubt, Tanner
derived the meagre reference made to the Cotton manu·
script in his Bibliotheca, p. 752. Since his time the
work appears to have been almost wholly ignored ; and
among recent historical writers, Mrs. Everett Green is
the only one who has occasionally availed herself of
the information it contains.³ She quotes it, however,
either as the work of an anonymous historiar, oras
the chronicle of Rishanger, which, of course, isan over-

sight
