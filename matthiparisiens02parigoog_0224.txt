roan, but with numerous alterations aud insertione.
Some of these are taken from the 01000100 Majoro
(references to which, under various titles, are frequently
made), but the majority contain new and interesting
matter, or give us the opinions of the writer in regard
to the conduct of the Sovereign and the affairs of the
Roman Court, which it is useful and instructive to
compare with those expressed in his other writings. In
the last two years, 1254 and 1255, the Greater Chronicle
is closely followed.

Although certainly in the handwriting of Matthew
Paris, the text exhibite numerous instaures of care·
lessness (as pointed out in the icet-notes), and hes
never received the author’s customary and final revision.
instanoee of verbal inaccuracies, omissione, and repeti-
tions occur throughout, of which it ia sufficient here
to refer to those which occur under the years 1053,1098,
1123, 1125, 1112, and 1201. These errors, however,
do not at all detract from the historical value of the
work, or from the confidenee we should place in the
general good saith and accuraoy cf the historiari.

In printing the text of this Chronicle, it has been
judged advisable to omit such passages as are verbally
the same with the Historia duplorum, and their
absence is indicated by dots. References are also added
in the margin to the printed pages of the latter work, in
which the omitted portions occur.

It is also desirable to point out (with greater precision
than was indicated in the Preface to vol. i. p. xxiii
note ¹), that the text of the present work has been ver-
irally copied into the original MS..of the Florce Hiaio-
riururn, falsely attributed to “ Matthew of Westmin-
ster,'’ from the words “Comes Ricardus cnm maxima
gloria,” in 1250 (vol iii. p. 311), to the end of the year

1255.
