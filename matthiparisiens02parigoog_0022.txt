He also enters under the year 1213 the singular story of
king John’s mission to Mohammed Al Nassir, the. Emir
Al-Mumenin, as related in his hearing by Robert of Lon-
don, the secular custos of st Alban's, to certain inmates
of the abbey.2 But there is some confusion in the
chronology here, for ifthe mission took place at all, it
must have been after the landing of Mohammed in Spain
in 1210, and previous to the battle of Novas de Tolosa,
fought in J uly 1212. Now, ae the custody of the abbey
was granted by king John to Robert of London and
Matthew Mantell‚ sheriff os Hertfordshire, on teth March
1208,³ he could not, as asserted by Paris, have been made
custodian in reward for hia services in this mission‚ nor
could the event have taken place after the death of
Geoffrey hita-Peter, the justiciary, in October 1213, as
stated by him. It will be, however, reasonable to con-
clude from the above that Matthcw Paris was attached
to the abbey several years before he assumed the monastic
habit, perhaps as a scholar, or in some other capacity.
But there are some events of still earlier date re· other

ferred to by Paris, which cause perplexity. Under the evenere-

year 1192 he narrates a story on the authority of {leth
