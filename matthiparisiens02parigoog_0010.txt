ΟΝ 110 aoth 01 January 1857, the Master 01110 Rolls
submitted to 110 Ireasury 0 proposal for the publication
01 materiale for the History 01 this Country from 110
Invasion 01 110 Romans to the Reign 01 Hemy VIII.

Γ11οΜ0010001 110 Bolis suggested 1101 11000 materiale
should 10 selected for publication under competent
editors without reference to periodical or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgmcnt, prefer-
ence being given, in 110 first instance, 10 such materials
as were most scarce and valuablc.

He proposed that each chronicle or historioal docu-
ment 10 10 edited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged 00 00 Editio Princeps; and
for this purpose 110 most correct text should 10 formed
from an accurate collation 01110 best MSS.

'Io render the work more generally useful, the Master
of 110 Rolls suggested that 110 editor should give an
account 01110 MSS. employed by him, 01 their age and
their peculiarities3 that 10 should add to the work a
brief account 01 110 life and times 01 110 author, and any
'remarks necessary 10 explain the chronology3 but no
other note or comment was 10 10 allowed, except what
might bc necessary to establish the correctness of 110
