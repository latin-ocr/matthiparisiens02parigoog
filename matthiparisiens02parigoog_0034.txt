It 10 now time to speak of the literary labours 0100111101-

Matthew Paria On the death of Roger of wendover, in ffifom
May 1236, he was, no doubt, directed by the abbat J ohn br Mac

of Hertford (elected only the year previous) ao continue 1110011111.

and enlarge his historical work, a task for which he had
probably been previously prepared. As already re·
marked, it is uncertain at what time Wendover began
to compile 1110110100 Η10101101001, but there are good
grounds for believing that it was not until after 1110
deposition 110111 Βο11011 and return to St Alban'e, about
the year 1219.1 At all events, the text 01 the year 1179
could 1101 have been written by him till after 1215, from
the referende made in it to the council held in the latter
year.s Itis obvious, moreover‚ that the chief authorities
used by Wendover in the compilation 01 his 0111011010,
namely, Bede, Geoffrey 01 Monmouth, Sigebert, Florence
01 1101000101, Simeon 01 Barbam, Malmesbury, Hunting-
don, Robert de 1101110, William 01 Tyra, Diceto, Bene·
1101110 Abbas, Ηο101011,8 1111 Ooggeshale, were 1101 likely
to be found 111 the library of a small cell like Belvoir,
whereas 01 St Alban’s they were ready 10 his hands.
Whether brother Matthew gave him any assistance in Did 1101
his work may admit of question, but it certainly appears ffiffip
highly probable. At times the style 01 Wendover’s text
is very similar to that of Paris, and this appears the
more as we approach its terminationss This 10 particu-
larly the case 111 the three chapters relative to Peter de
Rivaux and others 111 1234, which it is difficult to
believe were 1101 written by Paris ;⁴ and in the original
