phers‚ to the time of Tanner, have attributed to him the
lives of several saints and other treatises, but without
authority.² Wslsingham, however, says of him, “ Vitas
SS. Albani, Thornae, et Edmundi, archiepiscoporum
eantuariae, corrumpsit et dcpimoeit elegantissime.'’⁸
Whether ‘⁸ conscripsit '’ here means compoeed or trun-
acrihcd may admit of doubt, but it is worthy of note
that Stowe in his “Annales,’'⁴ and archbishop Ussher⁶ ¹
have ascribed to Matthew Paris a French metrical version

of Ralph of Dunstahle's Poaaio SS. Albuci et Amphihuli.
'l'hey must both have derived this information fmm the
same source, namely, a manuscript still fortunately pre-
servedin the librury of Trinity college, Duhliu, which con-
tains the Frenoh Life referred to, together with the Latin
original, and other legende of the same ιιιίιιιι.6 It does
